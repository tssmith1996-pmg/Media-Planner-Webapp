# Media Plan UI Previews

The screenshots below capture the current Media Planner workflow referenced in QA updates.

- **Dashboard** – plan overview with card/list toggle and prominent client metadata.
- **Plan detail** – hierarchical channel table with expandable flightings and detail modal trigger.

To regenerate locally, run `npm run dev -- --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4173` and capture the screens via Playwright or your preferred tool.
